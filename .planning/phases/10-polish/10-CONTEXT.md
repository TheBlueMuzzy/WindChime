# Phase 10: Polish - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-10
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Two focused additions to make the app feel finished:

1. **Detection indicator overlay** — When the camera locks onto a QR code, something clear and obvious appears right where the code is. The user should be able to SEE that detection is happening — a highlight box, checkmark, or icon overlaid on the camera feed at the code's position. No guessing whether it worked.

2. **Camera permission denied help screen** — When camera access fails or is denied, show a step-by-step guide in plain English explaining how to enable camera in their browser settings. Not just a vague error — actual instructions that walk them through fixing it.

The app is already basically good. This isn't a redesign — it's adding two specific pieces of feedback that make the difference between "prototype" and "finished."

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Detection indicator is clear and positioned on the code** — not ambient or screen-wide, but an obvious overlay right where the QR code is detected
- **Permission help screen actually helps** — step-by-step instructions, not just "camera access denied" with a retry button. Guide them through enabling it.
- Both are equally important — if either is missing, the app feels unfinished

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- No major visual redesign — add polish to what's already there
- No fancy animation or motion design — functional clarity over flair
- No new features beyond detection indicator and permission help screen
- Keep it focused and don't over-engineer

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — open to standard approaches for the indicator overlay and permission help content.

## Additional Context

Muzzy noted the app is "basically good" as-is. This phase is about closing the last two UX gaps, not rethinking anything. The app already works well — these are the finishing touches.

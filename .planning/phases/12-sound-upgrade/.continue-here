# Resume Point: Phase 12 — Sound Upgrade

**Paused:** 2026-02-10
**Version:** 0.1.2.6

## What Just Happened

Plan 12-01 (Python Setup + Duplicate Detection) is **complete**.

- Python audio environment installed (pydub, librosa, numpy, qrcode[pil])
- ffmpeg available (installed via winget, may need PATH refresh after reboot)
- Duplicate detection ran — found 2 exact duplicate pairs
- Muzzy deleted Chime_09 and Chime_11, renumbered remaining files
- **18 source files** in `audio/Source2/` (Chime_01 through Chime_18)

## What's Next

**Plan 12-02: Splice 100 clips from curated sources**

- 100 five-second clips from 18 source files (~5-6 clips per source)
- 200ms fade-in, 500ms fade-out
- Output to `audio/spliced2/` as `Chime_001.mp3` through `Chime_100.mp3`
- Then copy to `public/sounds/` and regenerate `chime-data.js`

## Known Environment Notes

- Python 3.12 at: `/c/Users/Muzzy/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps/python3.exe`
- ffmpeg installed via winget — after reboot, verify `ffmpeg -version` works. If not on PATH, the binary is at:
  `/c/Users/Muzzy/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WinGet/Packages/Gyan.FFmpeg_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe/ffmpeg-8.0.1-full_build/bin/`
- 18 source files (not 20) — Plan 02 needs to distribute 100 clips across 18 sources

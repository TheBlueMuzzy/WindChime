<objective>
Update the QR test page and create a printable card layout using the correct Chime_XX IDs.

Purpose: The existing test page (test-assets/qr-chime-1.html) uses the old "chime-1" value which no longer matches anything. Update it to use Chime_XX IDs that match CHIME_IDS in the app. Also create a printable layout for physical card testing.
Output: Updated test page with randomizable QR codes, printable card layout HTML.

# Prior plan in this phase:
@.planning/phases/04-test-content/04-01-SUMMARY.md

# Key source files:
@src/App.tsx

**CRITICAL — Current architecture (do NOT deviate):**
- There is NO `src/config/sounds.ts` — it was deleted
- There is NO SOUND_MAP — QR rawValues map directly to sound files
- App.tsx has a `CHIME_IDS` Set: `'Chime_01'` through `'Chime_24'`
- Sound files are at `/sounds/Chime_XX.mp3` (24 files)
- QR codes must encode values like `Chime_01`, `Chime_02`, etc. — NOT `chime-1`
- Scanner uses `allowMultiple={true}` with `scanDelay={500}`

**Constraining decisions:**
- QR rawValues must exactly match CHIME_IDS entries: "Chime_01" through "Chime_24"
- QR codes need to be large enough for phone camera to detect at arm's length (~3cm minimum)
- Test cards should be printable on standard letter paper

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update test page to use Chime_XX QR codes</name>
  <files>test-assets/qr-chime-1.html</files>
  <action>Rewrite test-assets/qr-chime-1.html to show 3 QR codes with a randomize button:

1. Display 3 QR code images in a row using the QR Server API:
   `https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?data=Chime_XX&size=300x300`
2. Each shows a random chime ID from Chime_01 through Chime_24
3. Label below each QR code showing which Chime_XX it encodes
4. "Randomize" button that picks 3 new random chime IDs (no duplicates) and updates all 3 images
5. Simple, clean styling — white background, centered layout

The page title should be "Wind Chime — QR Test Cards".
  </action>
  <verify>Open test-assets/qr-chime-1.html in browser — shows 3 QR codes with Chime_XX labels. Clicking Randomize changes all 3. Scanning any QR with the Wind Chime app plays the correct sound.</verify>
  <done>Test page shows 3 randomizable Chime_XX QR codes that the app recognizes</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create printable card layout</name>
  <files>test-assets/print-cards.html</files>
  <action>Create a self-contained HTML file that displays QR code cards for printing:

1. Show 6 cards (Chime_01 through Chime_06) in a 2x3 grid
2. Each card contains:
   - QR code image via QR Server API: `https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?data=Chime_XX&size=250x250`
   - Label below: "Chime 01", "Chime 02", etc.
   - Dotted border for cut guide
3. Card size: ~7cm x 7cm (fits 6 on letter paper)
4. Print CSS: hide browser chrome, no background colors, high-contrast
5. Instructions at top (hidden when printing): "Print this page, cut along dotted lines, scan with Wind Chime app"
6. Optional: dropdown or input to select which 6 chimes to print (default: 01-06)
  </action>
  <verify>Open test-assets/print-cards.html in browser — shows 6 QR code cards with labels. Print preview shows clean cards with cut guides. Each QR code scannable by phone camera.</verify>
  <done>Printable HTML with 6 QR cards exists, self-contained, print-friendly, each QR code scannable and correctly labeled</done>

  <how-to-verify>
    1. Open test-assets/qr-chime-1.html — verify 3 QR codes with Chime_XX labels
    2. Click Randomize — verify new codes appear
    3. Open Wind Chime app on phone (dev server on port 5213)
    4. Tap to begin scanning
    5. Point phone at QR codes on screen — verify each plays the correct chime sound
    6. Open test-assets/print-cards.html — verify 6 printable cards
    7. Scan those QR codes too — verify they play correct sounds

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] test-assets/qr-chime-1.html shows 3 randomizable Chime_XX QR codes
- [ ] test-assets/print-cards.html shows 6 printable Chime_XX QR cards
- [ ] All QR codes encode correct Chime_XX values (NOT chime-1/2/3)
- [ ] Scanning QR codes with the app triggers correct sounds
- [ ] `npm run build` still succeeds
- [ ] Phase 4 complete — all test content ready

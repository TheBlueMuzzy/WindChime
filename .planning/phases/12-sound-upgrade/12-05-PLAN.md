Deploy the upgraded app to GitHub Pages and verify end-to-end functionality.

Purpose: Get the 100-sound dynamic version live and confirm everything works — scanning, sound playback, QR codes page, dynamic discovery.
Output: Live deployment at thebluemuzzy.github.io/WindChime/ with 100 sounds and dynamic discovery.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Build and deploy to GitHub Pages</name>
  <files>dist/</files>
  <action>
1. Run `npm run build` to produce the production build
2. Verify `dist/` contains:
   - All 100 sound files in `dist/sounds/`
   - `manifest.json` in `dist/sounds/`
   - `codes.html` in `dist/`
   - App bundle files
3. Run `npm run deploy` to push to GitHub Pages
4. Wait for deployment to propagate (~1-2 minutes)

  <verify>npm run deploy completes without errors. curl https://thebluemuzzy.github.io/WindChime/ returns 200.</verify>

  <how-to-verify>
    1. Open on phone: https://thebluemuzzy.github.io/WindChime/
    2. Tap to unlock audio
    3. Point at QR codes — sounds should play (these are the new 100 clips)
    4. Verify sounds have smooth fade-in/fade-out, no harsh cuts
    5. Open QR codes page: https://thebluemuzzy.github.io/WindChime/codes.html
    6. Verify all 100 chimes appear in the grid (scroll through)
    7. Tap Randomize — should pick 3 random chimes from the full 100
    8. Scan one of the randomized QR codes with the app — confirm it plays

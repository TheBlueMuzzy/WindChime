# Project State

## Current Status
PRD complete. Ready to create roadmap and start building.

## Version
0.1.0.0

## Last Session
- Created PRD with all 12 sections
- Key decisions: Barcode Detection API for multi-QR scanning, Web Audio API for layered playback
- Scope: Prototype — functional, not pretty

## Known Issues
- iOS Safari doesn't support Barcode Detection API natively (defer to later milestone)

## Next Steps
- Run `/gsd:new-project` to create the roadmap and start building
- OR jump straight to coding if you want to move fast

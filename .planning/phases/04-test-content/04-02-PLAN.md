<objective>
Generate 3 printable QR codes and a print-ready layout so the app can be tested with physical cards on a table.

Purpose: Create the physical test assets needed for real-world testing — QR codes that map to the 3 wind chime sounds, formatted for easy printing and cutting.
Output: 3 QR code SVGs, a printable HTML page with all 3 cards, and updated test-assets directory.

# Key source files:
@src/config/sounds.ts
@test-assets/qr-chime-1.html

**Tech stack available:** Node.js for scripting, HTML for printable layout
**Established patterns:** QR test card HTML (test-assets/qr-chime-1.html), SOUND_MAP keys are QR rawValues
**Constraining decisions:**
- QR rawValues must exactly match SOUND_MAP keys: "chime-1", "chime-2", "chime-3"
- QR codes need to be large enough for phone camera to detect at arm's length (~3cm minimum)
- Test cards should be printable on standard letter paper

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Generate QR code SVGs for all 3 chime values</name>
  <files>scripts/generate-qr-codes.mjs, test-assets/qr-chime-1.svg, test-assets/qr-chime-2.svg, test-assets/qr-chime-3.svg</files>
  <action>Create a Node.js script that generates QR code SVG files for each SOUND_MAP key. Use the `qrcode` npm package (install as devDependency: `npm install -D qrcode`).

For each value ("chime-1", "chime-2", "chime-3"):
1. Generate QR code as SVG string using `QRCode.toString(value, { type: 'svg', margin: 2 })`
2. Write to test-assets/qr-chime-{N}.svg

Keep it simple — standard QR codes, black on white, no logo or custom styling.

Run the script after creation to generate the files.
  </action>
  <verify>3 SVG files exist in test-assets/ (qr-chime-1.svg, qr-chime-2.svg, qr-chime-3.svg), each >500 bytes, valid SVG</verify>
  <done>3 QR code SVGs generated, each encoding the correct chime ID string</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create printable card layout HTML</name>
  <files>test-assets/print-cards.html</files>
  <action>Create a self-contained HTML file that displays all 3 QR code cards in a print-friendly layout:

1. Page layout: 3 cards arranged in a single row (or 2+1 for smaller paper)
2. Each card contains:
   - The QR code SVG (inlined, not referenced — file must be self-contained)
   - A label below: "Chime 1", "Chime 2", "Chime 3"
   - A dotted border for cut guide
3. Card size: ~7cm x 7cm (fits 3 across on letter paper landscape)
4. Print CSS: hide browser chrome, no background colors, high-contrast black on white
5. Instructions at top (hidden when printing): "Print this page, cut along dotted lines, scan with Wind Chime app"

Read the generated SVG files and inline their content into the HTML. This ensures the print page works as a single standalone file.

Also remove the old test-assets/qr-chime-1.html (superseded by this comprehensive print page).
  </action>
  <verify>Open test-assets/print-cards.html in a browser — shows 3 QR code cards with labels. Print preview shows clean cards with cut guides. Each QR code scannable by phone camera.</verify>
  <done>Printable HTML with 3 QR cards exists, self-contained, print-friendly, each QR code scannable and labeled</done>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>3 printable QR code cards — open test-assets/print-cards.html in browser, verify QR codes scan correctly and map to the right sounds</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Open test-assets/print-cards.html in browser
    2. Verify 3 cards visible with QR codes and labels (Chime 1, Chime 2, Chime 3)
    3. Open Wind Chime app on phone (npm run dev)
    4. Tap to enable sound
    5. Point phone camera at each QR code on your computer screen:
       - Chime 1 QR → should trigger chime-1 sound
       - Chime 2 QR → should trigger chime-2 sound
       - Chime 3 QR → should trigger chime-3 sound
    6. Confirm: each QR maps to the correct, distinct sound
    7. (Optional) Print the page and test with physical cards

- [ ] QR codes scannable by phone camera from computer screen
- [ ] Each code triggers the correct mapped sound
- [ ] `npm run build` still succeeds
- [ ] Phase 4 complete — all test content ready
